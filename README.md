# Number Guessing Game in C++

## Overview

This is a simple number guessing game written in C++. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. Yay!

## How to Compile and Run

### Linux/Mac

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the C++ file (either `guess_game.cpp`).
2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ guess_game.cpp -o guess_game
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./guess_game

   ```

### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder containing the C++ file.
2. Compile the code:
   ```
   g++ guess_game.cpp -o guess_game.exe
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```
   guess_game.exe
   ```

## Features

- The game provides hints for each guess ("Too high" or "Too low").
- The `guess_game.cpp` version allows players to play again without restarting the application.
